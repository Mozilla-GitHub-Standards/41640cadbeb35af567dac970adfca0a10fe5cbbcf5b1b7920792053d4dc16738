#Welcome to the Contribution Bazaar! 
Find contributors, collaborators, or new projects to work on here! 
<br>
Note: This is an experiment, we'll be running it for Q1. If you like it let me know by emailing lucy@mozilla.com. 

Here's how it works (posting): 
- Step 1: Identify a task or projects you need help on (make sure it is something that can be completed in a fixed amount of time) i.e. Say "looking for 10 new foxfooders" instead of "looking for foxfooders"
- Step 2: Use the issue template below to create your issue
- Step 3: When your issue is completed (yay!) say thank you to your new friend and close the issue

Here's how it works (contributing): 
- Step 1: Identify a task or projects you would like to help with (or search by labels)
- Step 2: Read the issue and follow the instructions
- Step 3: Leave a comment for more information or if you have a question
- Step 3: When you're done (yay!) close the issue

## Issues Template: 
Use this format when creating an issue to capture what you would like done. 

* Title: [Should state what you are looking for in concrete terms i.e. "Need Copy Review"] 
* Goal: [What do you want done]
* Info: [What it will be used for/where it will go]
* Additional Information: [Link to exmaples, references, similar things etc.]
* Deadline: [When would you like this done by]
* Tag: [Writer Needed, Developer Needed, Collaborator Needed, Tester Needed etc.]

Note: Because of the way permissions work on this repo, if you can't add a label yourself, indicate the label you want added in the body of the issue and someone will add it for you.
