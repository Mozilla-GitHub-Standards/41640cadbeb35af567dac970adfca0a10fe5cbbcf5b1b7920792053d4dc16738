# Contribute 
Welcome to the Contribution Bazaar! Find contributors, collaborators, or new projects here! 
(This is in the experimental phase, we'll be running it for x weeks to see how it works. If you like it let us know!)

Here's how it works: 
Step 1: Post tasks and projects you need help on
Step 2: Choose a label to indicate the kind of help you need
Step 3: When your issue is completed (yay!) close it

Rules: 
1. Give all the information someone would need to complete the task in the issue description
2. Monitor your issues in case people have questions
3. Thank people who work on your issues!
