#Welcome to the Contribution Bazaar! 
Find contributors, collaborators, or new projects and ways to contribute here.

Note: This is an experiment, we'll be running it for Q1. 

**What should you post?** Any requests with a specific call to action! For example requesting that someone DO something, MAKE something, REGISTER for something, SHARE something. 

Here's how it works (posting): 
- Step 1: Identify a task or projects you need help on that has a specific call to action.  I.e."Looking for 10 New Foxfooding Volunteers to Sign-Up" instead of "looking for foxfooders"
- Step 2: Use the issue template below to create your issue
- Step 3: When your issue is completed (yay!) say thank you to your new friend and close the issue

Here's how it works (contributing): 
- Step 1: Identify a task or projects you would like to help with (or search by labels)
- Step 2: Read the issue and follow the instructions
- Step 3: Leave a comment for more information or if you have a question
- Step 3: When you're done (yay!) close the issue

## Issues Template: 
Use this format when creating an issue to capture what you would like done. 

* Title: [Should state what you are looking for in terms of a call to action i.e. "Need Copy Review"] 
* Goal: [What do you want people to do/make/fix/sign-up for]
* Info: [Why should they do this? Where will it be used? How much time is required]
* Additional Information: [Link to exmaples, references, similar things etc.]
* Deadline: [When would you like this done by]
* Tag: [Writer Needed, Developer Needed, Collaborator Needed, Tester Needed etc.]

Note: Because of the way permissions work on this repo, if you can't add a label yourself, indicate the label you want added in the body of the issue and someone will add it for you.
